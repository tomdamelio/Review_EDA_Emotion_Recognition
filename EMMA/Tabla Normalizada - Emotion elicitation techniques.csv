In this regard, the experimentation monitor consists of a high resolution, 28 inch screen. When the technician verifies the proper functioning of the wearable and its communication with the software, the experiment starts. Firstly, the participant has to carefully read the general instructions of the experiment. Then, ten pictures that are labelled with high arousal and low valence are shown consecutively during 6 s each to the participant. Silences consisting of blank images with a fixed duration of 1 s are inserted before each picture used from the database. The pictures are selected randomly from the set of images that fulfil the condition. Therefore, the segment used for subsequent analysis is 70 s long (10 pictures 6 s duration, plus one blank image before each picture). In this sense, a single presentation of many stimuli presented for a short period of time might favour the continuity of emotional state [29]. Afterwards, a distracting task is presented to the participant so that his/her emotional state comes to neutral. Next, the experiment continues by showing randomly another set of ten images from IAPS that fulfil the condition to be part of those previously labelled as low arousal and high valence. Therefore, two segments of data from each individual are finally obtained, one for calm condition and another for distress condition. Again, silences are used before each picture. Lastly, the distracting task is offered again.",6s,-,-,-

sudden turning (Cohen and Wills, 1985; Yamaguchi et al., 2006; Öz et al., 2010; Chen,

(Stephens and Groeger, 2006; Laing, 2010). Neutral and stress driving were performed
monotonously, whereas angry driving was performed simultaneously with four artificial
intelligence opponents.
The subjects were provided with three minutes of training period to familiarise them

80 km/h (Chen, 2013). Driving track at this speed was composed of a wide circular
roadway with good vision. Stress driving was performed at a snowy mountain track with
narrow road and poor vision. Stress was triggered by causing the vehicle to drift via
sudden turning (Cohen and Wills, 1985; Yamaguchi et al., 2006; Öz et al., 2010; Chen,
2013). Anger stimulation places time constraint on the driver. The drivers also face
demanding situations, such as tailgating, sudden over-taking, and reckless driving
(Stephens and Groeger, 2006; Laing, 2010). Neutral and stress driving were performed
monotonously, whereas angry driving was performed simultaneously with four artificial
intelligence opponents.
The subjects were provided with three minutes of training period to familiarise them
with the control of driving unit. The subjects then performed three sets of control,
driving, and recovery sessions. Each session was composed of a pre-designed
emotion-stimulating scenario. In the control and recovery sessions, the subjects were
required to close their eyes and rest with their palms facing upward",50m,-,-,-

circular roadway with a wide road and good vision [14]. The
stress scenario consists of a snowy mountain track with a
narrow road and poor vision, presumed to trigger sudden
turning, leading to vehicle drifting and impact [8][14][15][16].

designated driving task within a time limit. This task was

tailgating, sudden overtaking, and reckless driving [17][18].
